# Multi-Label Medical Image Classification with MetaTeacher

## Project Overview
This project, helmed by Sukhmani Sandhu, Arpita Jadhav, and Saurabh Rajput, presents a groundbreaking approach to multi-label medical image classification. Leveraging the NIH-CXR14 dataset, our model, MetaTeacher, demonstrates exceptional prowess in interpreting complex chest X-ray images. This work stands at the forefront of marrying deep learning with medical image analysis, opening new avenues in diagnostic methodologies.
